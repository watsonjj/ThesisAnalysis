# ThesisAnalysis

This repository contains the scripts to produce all the plots in my thesis. The scripts are split into three categories:

1. Reduction - Reduce larger datasets (including tio waveform files) into smaller datasets ready for plotting. These smaller datasets are stored in the data directory of this repository.
2. Analysis - Use the smaller datasets produced by the Reduction scripts to generate plots to be used in my thesis.
3. External - More complicated scripts where seperate reduction and analysis steps was harder to define. These scripts read in large datasets and produce plots for my thesis.

All the plots for my thesis can be found in the "plots" directory.

The thesis latex document itself can be found at https://github.com/watsonjj/Thesis.
